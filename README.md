## Repository for the C# projects while attending The Tech Academy

This is the repo of the various projects and drills that were required for completing the C# course, with the 2 main projects for completion of the course being the Car Insurance drill and the Knockout.js project.

The car insurance drill was a culmination of many different methods of C# coming together to create one main project utilizing the methods that were covered in the course. We also had to have the program write data to our local DataBase to store the quotes for later retrieval under an admin.

The Knockout.js project was my attempt at learning how to use knockout and making a project that utilizes it. The knockout project was very fun as it was mostly about learning how to research and implement a new coding style that I was not familiar with and better prepared myself for what was to come in the Live Project course.
